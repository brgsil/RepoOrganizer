These project is a repository hub for all research lines from the [Hub for Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/en/) (H.IAAC) of the [State University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) (UNICAMP)

The Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures Hub aims to develop and disseminate knowledge about technologies capable of integrating different intelligence resources into mobile devices, making them skilled in decision-making.

The Hub aims to develop research to expand the cognitive and decision-making capacity of mobile devices, such as tablets and cell phones, making life easier for users.  Unicamp researchers will be responsible for producing and disseminating technological knowledge, while ELDORADO will develop application prototypes.

The Hub's team is made up of undergraduate, master's and doctoral students, post-docs and professors from Unicamp, in addition to professionals from ELDORADO.
