These project is a repository hub for projects develop by the Cognitive Architectures research line from the [Hub for Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/en/) (H.IAAC) of the [State University of Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) (UNICAMP)

This line of research has the mission of advancing the state of the art of artificial intelligence through the proposal of cognitive computational models inspired by the in-depth study of the many forms of intelligence in nature, the development of intelligence in childhood, the role of emotions and interactions, decision-making processes and the most recent neuroscientific discoveries.

In particular, the line seeks to develop the first mobile cognitive architecture, based on the Cognitive Systems Toolkit (CST), aiming to implement innovative and customized functionalities for users of mobile devices based on a more intelligent processing of sensor data, identification of profiles and contexts of usage, and emotional states of users.
